👋 Hello, I'm Ahmed Hossam, a junior SWE graduate with a year of hands-on experience.

👀 I'm passionate about backend system design, distributed systems and databases, and building highly scalable and performant applications. I also deeply care about user experience and performance!

🌍 I love open source and am currently a Google Summer of Code contributor for 2024 with OTSF.

🌱 I'm exploring various backend technologies, including Node.js, Ruby, and Go, to broaden my skills and knowledge. ❤️

💼 I'm actively seeking internship opportunities to further enhance my skills and gain valuable experience.

🏆 I've participated in competitive programming with 2x ECPC and one ACPC (Arab Collegiate Programming Contest).
